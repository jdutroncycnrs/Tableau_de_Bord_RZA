<p>Abstract:<br>Climate change can influence populations of monogamous species by affecting pair-bond dynamics. This study examined the impact of climate on widowhood and divorce, and the subsequent effects on individual vital rates and life-history outcomes over 54 years in a snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea) population. We found that environmental conditions can affect pair-bond dynamics both directly and indirectly. Divorce was adaptive, occurring more frequently after breeding failure and leading to improved breeding success. Divorce probabilities also increased under severe climatic conditions, regardless of prior breeding success, supporting the ""Habitat-mediated&rdquo; mechanisms. Generally, pair-bond disruptions reduced subsequent vital rates and lifetime outcomes. Climate forecasts from an Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model projected increased male widowhood rates due to decreased sea ice negatively affecting female survival, despite considerable uncertainty. These findings highlight the importance of environmentally induced changes in demographic and pair-bond disruption rates as crucial factors shaping demographic responses to climate change.&nbsp;</p>

1,Zenodo, Zone atelier Alpes,10966598,Vegetation changes with climate change in the Grandes Rousses mountain range,"Michalet, Richard","<p><strong><em>Questions:</em></strong> We assessed interactions between climate change, bedrock types and snow cover duration on the trajectories of taxonomic and functional composition of subalpine plant communities. We predict (i) an increase in species richness on siliceous bedrock due to a reduced competition and a decrease in richness on calcareous bedrock due to increasing drought stress, (ii) decreasing snow cover duration should induce a higher shrub encroachment in hollows as compared to ridges (iii) increasing growing season temperature should induce taller sizes and more conservative growth traits, in particular in hollows.</p>
<p><strong><em>Location: </em></strong>Subalpine belt of the Grandes Rousses mountain range, south western Alps (France).</p>
<p><strong><em>Methods:</em></strong> 189 vegetation plots were sampled in 1997 and 2017-2018. The duration of snow cover was assessed during two years in 1995-1997 and five functional traits were measured on 108 species in 2021. We performed multivariate analyses, quantified community weighted-means (CWM) of traits and used ANOVAs to detect responses to local-scale factors and changes in snow cover, temperature and precipitation since 1997 according to a nearby meteorological station.</p>
<p><strong><em>Results:</em></strong> Overall, taxonomic composition weakly changed and changes were more dependent on the position of communities along the snow cover duration gradient than on their bedrock type. The abundance of drought-tolerant species increased at the border of hollows and there was, over all communities, a slight increase in the abundance of dwarf shrubs and tall herbaceous species, a strong decrease in short herbaceous species and, thus, an overall decrease in species richness. There were important overall changes in CWM of size traits, in particular leaf area which increased the most in hollows irrespective of bedrock types.</p>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion:</em></strong> In this subalpine site the effects of decreasing snow cover duration overwhelmed the effects of bedrocks, which may explain the overall increase in competitive species and decrease in species richness.</p>",2024-04-12,10.5061/dryad.zkh1893hw

Le groupe régional d'experts sur le climat en région Sud Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (GREC-SUD) a rapporté en 2018, une élévation des températures observées actuellement dans les Alpes deux fois plus importante que celle notée en plaine. Le suivi de ces processus est à privilégier dans les espaces protégés. La pérennité des parcs nationaux ainsi que la présence d'agents qualifiés sur le terrain sont autant d'éléments facilitant la mise en œuvre d'études opérationnelles sur ces territoires d'exception. Au travers de deux exemples développés au sein du Parc national des Écrins, nous présentons deux protocoles distincts ayant pour cadre l'étude des changements globaux et intégrant les Mollusques continentaux en tant qu'indicateur de ces évolutions. Le premier de ces dispositifs concerne la mise en place de transects altitudinaux permettant de caractériser les peuplements malacologiques (diversité spécifique et abondance) intégrés au sein de l'observatoire ORCHAMP.&nbsp;Ce dispositif de recherche multi partenarial de la Zone Atelier Alpes (ZAA) a pour objectif de suivre la dynamique des écosystèmes de montagne face aux changements globaux (climat, pollution, changements de pratiques, etc.). Le second dispositif concerne un protocole d'étude portant sur la dynamique biologique des marges glaciaires, initié dans le cadre du programme européen ALCOTRA « CclimatT » dont l'objectif est d'appréhender les organismes et communautés d'organismes qui colonisent des zones récemment libérées des glaces à l'échelle du Quaternaire.

4,Zenodo, Zone atelier Armorique,7566380,Discrepancies between the drivers of alpha and beta plant diversity in arable field margins,"Boinot, Sébastien","<p><span>Field margins are major habitats for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem functioning in agricultural landscapes, but biotic homogenization of plant communities threatens their ecological and agronomic functions. Our objective is to assess the effects of field margin structure and long-term management of herbaceous layer over 20 years (1995–2015) on the taxonomic and functional α- and β-diversity, and the functional composition of herbaceous plant communities. In 2015, we surveyed 302 field margins in bocage landscapes of Brittany (France). Results were very similar between taxonomic and functional diversity but revealed discrepancies between α- and β-diversity. Deep ditches, mowing, and grazing increased α-diversity but did not affect β-diversity. Denser hedgerows had lower α-diversity than other field margins but contributed to β-diversity by harboring more unique sets of species or life strategies. Long-term herbicide spraying in field margins and cropping intensity in adjacent habitats did not affect α-diversity, but had more complex effects on β-diversity and selected for common weeds. Preservation of dense hedgerows and abandonment of herbicide spraying are key measures to prevent the establishment of common weeds and biotic homogenization in field margins. Above all, our study shows how important it is to go beyond α-diversity to make robust conservation and restoration decisions.</span></p>",2023-01-24,10.5061/dryad.79cnp5hz9
5,Zenodo, Zone atelier Armorique,7199900,"Weed communities are more diverse, but not more abundant, in dense and complex bocage landscapes","Boinot, Sébastien","<p>1. Bocage landscapes are characterized by a network of hedgerows that delimits arable fields. Such landscapes provide many ecosystem services, including biodiversity conservation, but their effects on weed communities remain largely unknown. Bocage landscapes could affect weed communities through two main processes: plant spillover from hedgerows and increased environmental heterogeneity in arable fields. These bocage effects are also likely to vary between farming systems (conventional vs organic), due to differences in management practices.</p>
<p>2. We sampled weed communities more than 20 m from field margins in 74 arable fields (37 per farming system). Fields were located along two independent landscape gradients of total length of hedgerows (with or without a shrub layer) and organic farming cover, in Brittany (France). We analysed the effect of 'bocage' (i.e., the density and complexity of hedgerow networks) and farming systems at field and landscape scales on species and functional diversity of weed communities. Further, we used fidelity to non-crop habitats and Ellenberg indicator values to assess the 'plant spillover' and 'environmental heterogeneity' hypotheses, respectively.</p>
<p>3. Weed communities were more diverse and more abundant in organic farming systems. In addition, weed communities were more diverse, but not more abundant, in denser and more complex bocage landscapes. 'Bocage' increased species diversity of weeds, but also community-weighted variance of specific leaf area, plant height and seed mass. Positive effects of 'bocage' on weed diversity were driven by increased environmental heterogeneity rather than spillover of transient species from hedgerows. 'Bocage' effects were independent of farming systems at field and landscape scales.</p>
<p>4. Synthesis and applications. Maintaining diverse weed communities is key to agroecological weed management and biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes. Farmers are often concerned that hedgerows harbour competitive plants spreading into field edges, thereby increasing weed pressure. However, our study shows that dense and complex bocage landscapes promote weed diversity in field cores, most likely by increasing environmental heterogeneity. Thus, bocage landscapes could actually enhance ecosystem services provided by weed communities and reduce weed-crop competition.</p>",2022-10-14,10.5061/dryad.k0p2ngfbv

(2021) Strong links between plant traits and microbial activities but different abiotic drivers in mountain grasslands (accepted in Journal of Biogeography).</p>

<p>We used an extensive plant-soil dataset that covers 14 elevational gradients (between 1500 and 2800 m of elevation) distributed over the whole French Alps to analyse the spatial co-dependencies between the plant and soil compartments. We ran a Graphical Lasso that extracts the direct and indirect linkages between plant functional composition, soil microbial activities, and environmental conditions (local climate and soil properties).</p>

<p>Our main results are 1) that plant traits are tightly associated with microbial activities, the former being driven by climate and the latter by soil properties; 2) that the dominance of specific plant traits was more important than their diversity to determine plant-soil linkages; and 3) that soil microbes invested strongly in nutrient acquisition in sites with conservative plant traits and reduced organic matter quality.</p>",2022-07-14,10.5061/dryad.cjsxksn63

Water temperature is not high, in the range of 12.9 to 16.6&deg;C for our measurements. The spring is rich in several major elements e.g. sodium, calcium and, the concentration in nitrate is lower less than 10 mg L- 1 (Table 1). High trace elements concentrations such as boron, strontium, barium, manganese and arsenic are found in the 2018 sample (Table 2). In October 2019, physical parameters and ionic concentrations are significantly different than the other periods of sampling, e.g. electrical conductivity, usually about 7600 &micro;S. cm-1, has dropped to 5390 &micro;S. cm-1 and chloride content has divided by two.</p>   <p> The Sail spring displays a very peculiar pattern regarding radioactivity: radon concentration in water varies significantly along the year and can reach significant levels up to 1000 Becquerels per liter. Indeed, the equivalent doses recorded (in nanoSieverts per hour) were on average 150 nSv h-1 and 270 nSv h-1 when measuring at 1-meter height above the spring and at the water level respectively. These values are in agreement with the mean background values of Auvergne region (150&ndash;200 nSv h-1) without indicating any significant radioactive signature. The water sample collected for gamma-spectroscopy measurements showed a significant Radon activity of 1006.1 &plusmn; 1.6 Bq L- 1.</p>   <p> <i>Chamaepinnularia salina</i> was also present in each sample taken in 11 other springs of the French Massif Central (Figs 41&ndash;44; 45). In these springs, the relative abundance of <i>C. salina</i> varied between 0.2% (one individual in Zagat and Tete de Lion springs) and 50.6% (Camuse spring). All the springs were characterized by high conductivity (between 1464 &micro;S. cm-1 and 7240 &micro;S. cm-1) and by high sodium and potassium contents (Fig. 45). Major anions are bicarbonates except for the Poix spring enriched in sulphate. For Camuse spring, where rock was brushed, <i>C. salina</i> was dominant (50.6%) associated with <i>Humidophila gallica</i> (W. Smith 1857: 11) R.L.Lowe, Kociolek, Q.You, Q.Wang &amp; Stepanek (2017: 281) (30.8%).

<p>Our main results are 1) that plant traits are tightly associated with microbial activities, the former being driven by climate and the latter by soil properties; 2) that the dominance of specific plant traits was more important than their diversity to determine plant-soil linkages; and 3) that soil microbes invested strongly in nutrient acquisition in sites with conservative plant traits and reduced organic matter quality.</p>",2022-07-14,10.5281/zenodo.5092154

P.","The ecosystem service of insect pest regulation by natural enemies, such as primary parasitoids, may be enhanced by the presence of uncultivated, semi-natural habitats within agro-ecosystems, although quantifying such host–parasitoid interactions is difficult. Here, we use rRNA 16S gene sequencing to assess both the level of parasitism by Aphidiinae primary parasitoids and parasitoid identity on a large sample of aphids collected in cultivated and uncultivated agricultural habitats in Western France. We used these data to construct ecological networks to assess the level of compartmentalization between aphid and parasitoid food webs of cultivated and uncultivated habitats. We evaluated the extent to which uncultivated margins provided a resource for parasitoids shared between pest and nonpest aphids. We compared the observed quantitative ecological network described by our molecular approach to an empirical qualitative network based on aphid–parasitoid interactions from traditional rearing data found in the literature. We found that the molecular network was highly compartmentalized and that parasitoid sharing is relatively rare between aphids, especially between crop and noncrop compartments. Moreover, the few cases of putative shared generalist parasitoids were questionable and could be due to the lack of discrimination of cryptic species or from intraspecific host specialization. Our results suggest that apparent competition mediated by Aphidiinae parasitoids is probably rare in agricultural areas and that the contribution of field margins as a source of these biocontrol agents is much more limited than expected. Further large-scale (spatial and temporal) studies on other crops and noncrop habitats are needed to confirm this.",2014-02-20,10.5061/dryad.v1q8j
23,Zenodo, Zone atelier arc jurassien,4281025,Numerical response of predators to large variations of grassland vole abundance and long-term community change,"Giraudoux, Patrick","<p>Voles can reach high densities with multi-annual population fluctuations of large amplitude, and they are at the base of predator communities in Northern Eurasia and Northern America. This status places them at the heart of management conflicts wherein crop protection and health concerns are often raised against conservation issues.<strong> Here, a 20-year survey describes the effects of large variations in grassland vole populations on the densities and the daily theoretical food intakes (TFI) of vole predators based on roadside counts.</strong> Our results show how the predator community responded to prey variations of large amplitude and how it reorganized with the increase in a dominant predator, here the red fox, which likely negatively impacted hare, European wildcat and domestic cat populations. This population increase did not lead to an increase in the average number of predators present in the study area, suggesting compensations among resident species due to intra-guild predation or competition. Large variations in vole predator number could be clearly attributed to the temporary increase in the populations of mobile birds of prey in response to grassland vole outbreaks. Our study provides empirical support for more timely and better focused actions in wildlife management and vole population control, and it supports an evidence-based and constructive dialogue about management targets and options between all stakeholders of such socio-ecosystems.</p>

25,Zenodo, Zone atelier Armorique,3823482,"Distribution of ticks, tick-borne pathogens and the associated local environmental factors including small mammals and livestock, in two French agricultural sites: the OSCAR database","Lebert, Isabelle","<p>In Europe, ticks are major vectors of both human and livestock pathogens (e.g. Lyme disease, granulocytic anaplasmosis, bovine babesiosis). Agricultural landscapes, where animal breeding is a major activity, constitute a mosaic of habitat types of various quality for tick survival and are used at different frequencies by wild and domestic hosts across seasons. This habitat heterogeneity, in time and space, conditions the dynamics of these host-vector-pathogen systems and thus drives acarological risk (defined as the density of infected ticks). The principal objective of the OSCAR project (2011-2016) was to examine the links between this heterogeneity and acarological risk for humans and their domestic animals. Here, we present the data associated with this project.</p><p>This paper reports a database on the distribution and densities of <i>I. ricinus</i> ticks - the most common tick species in French agricultural landscapes - and the prevalence of three tick-borne pathogens (<i>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</i>, <i>Borrelia</i> spp. and <i>Babesia</i> spp.) in two sites in north-western (""Zone Atelier Armorique"": ZA site) and south-western (""Vallées et Coteaux de Gascogne"": VG site) France. The distribution and density of ticks along a gradient of wooded habitats, as well as biotic variables, such as the presence and abundance of their principal domestic (livestock) and wild hosts (small mammals), were measured from forest cores and edges to more or less isolated hedges, all bordering meadows. Ticks, small mammals and information on local environmental conditions were collected along 90 transects in each of the two sites in spring and autumn 2012 and 2013 and in spring 2014, corresponding to the main periods of tick activity. Local environmental conditions were recorded along each tick and small mammal transect: habitat type, vegetation type and characteristics, slope and traces of livestock presence. Samples consisted of questing ticks collected on the vegetation (mainly <i>I. ricinus</i> nymphs), biopsies of captured small mammals and ticks fixed on small mammals. In the VG site, livestock occurrence and abundance were recorded each week along each tick transect.</p><p>A total of 29004 questing ticks and 1230 small mammals were captured during the study across the two sites and over the five field campaigns. All questing nymphs (N = 12287) and questing adults (N = 646) were identified to species. Ticks from small mammals (N = 1359) were also identified to life stage. Questing nymphs (N = 4518 <i>I. ricinus</i>) and trapped small mammals (N = 908) were analysed for three pathogenic agents: <i>A. phagocytophilum</i>, <i>Borrelia</i> spp. and <i>Babesia</i> spp.</p><p>In the VG site, the average prevalence in <i>I. ricinus</i> nymphs for <i>A. phagocytophilum</i>, <i>Borrelia</i> spp. and <i>Babesia</i> spp. were, respectively 1.9% [95% CI: 1.2-2.5], 2.5% [95% CI: 1.8-3.2] and 2.7% [95% CI: 2.0-3.4]. In small mammals, no <i>A. phagocytophilum</i> was detected, but the prevalence for <i>Borrelia</i> spp. was 4.2% [95% CI: 0.9-7.5].
