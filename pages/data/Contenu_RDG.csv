<ul>
<li>Enabling data reuse and knowledge discovery is increasingly critical in modern science, and requires an effort towards standardizing data publication practices. This is particularly challenging in the plant phenotyping domain, due to its complexity and heterogeneity.</li>
<li>We have produced the MIAPPE 1.1 release which enhances the existing MIAPPE standard in coverage, to support perennial plants, in structure, through an explicit data model, and in clarity, through definitions and examples.</li>
<li>We evaluated MIAPPE 1.1 by using it to express several heterogeneous phenotyping experiments in a range of different formats, to demonstrate its applicability and the interoperability between the various implementations. Furthermore, the extended coverage is demonstrated by the fact that one of the datasets could not have been described under MIAPPE 1.0.</li>
<li>MIAPPE 1.1 marks a major step towards enabling plant phenotyping data reusability, thanks to its extended coverage, and especially the formalization of its data model, which facilitates its implementation in different formats. Community feedback has been critical to this development, and will be a key part of ensuring adoption of the standard.</li>

The collection was assessed in 2017 in the field (4-years old trees), with four trees per variety. In July 2017, irrigation was withheld for two trees per variety, while the two other trees were maintained well-irrigated. Airborne imaging (thermal and multispectral) was deployed at four dates during the month of July  (on 5th, 12th, 17th and 27th July). Vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, MCARI2) were calculated from multispectral images. Mean canopy surface temperature (TS) was computed from thermal images, and differences between canopy surface and air temperature (TSTA) were then calculated to account for potential climate variations between dates. Two measurement campaigns were performed with a T-LiDAR scanner: one in October 2017 on leafy trees, and one in February 2018. Summer variables provided information on the canopy shape: alpha hull volume (a_volume), convex hull volume (c_volume) and plant height (height). c_volume represents the maximal space occupation of the tree, whereas a_volume represents the volume filled by leaves within this convex hull. For assessing light interception variables, we computed the STAR (Silhouette to Total Leaf Area Ratio). Finally, a convexity index (ci) correlated with STAR was computed as the ratio a_volume/c_volume. Winter scans were used to estimate tree architecture-related variables: the number of axes (nb_axes) and the total cumulative axis length (total_length) per tree. Along with genotypic data (https://doi.org/10.15454/F5XIVJ), this dataset was used to perform GWAS to detect SNPs associated with tree architecture, light interception and canopy surface temperature with the ultimate  goal of assessing to which extent these architectural and functional traits do or do not share a common genetic origin (Coupel-Ledru et al., 2022).

All accessions are grafted trees mostly located in the arboriculture experimental unit in Toulenne (latitude 44°34’37.442’’N – longitude 0°16’51.48’’O), near Bordeaux (France). For some accessions, several data have been also available from the French walnut experimental station of Creysse (latitude 44°53’16.529’’N – longitude 1°36’23.838’’E). The dataset consists in the raw phenotypic datafile, in ""csv"" format.",Earth and Environmental Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.607213

While genetically resis- tant varieties are becoming more accessible, populations of P. viticola are demonstrating rapid adaptability, successfully over- coming these resistances. Here we aimed to identify the aviru- lence genes involved in the interaction with the Rpv3.1-mediated resistance in grapevine. We sequenced the full genome of 136 P. viticola strains sampled in a natural population of Bordeaux (France) and characterized their development on both resis- tant and sensitive cultivars. The genome-wide association study allowed the identification of a genomic region associated with the breakdown of Rpv3.1 grapevine resistance (avrRpv3.1 lo- cus). A diploid-aware reassembly of the P. viticola INRA-Pv221 genome allowed to detect structural variations in this locus, in- cluding a major 30 Kbp deletion. At the avrRpv3.1 locus, vir- ulent P. viticola strains presented deletion on both haplotypes indicating that avirulence is recessive. The deletion involves two closely-related genes that encode proteins containing 800- 900 amino acids with a signal peptide. The structure of the predicted proteins contains repeats of the LWY-fold structural modules, typical of oomycete effectors. Moreover, when these proteins were transiently expressed, they induced cell death in grapevines carrying Rpv3.1 resistance, confirming their aviru- lence nature. The first description of candidate effectors of P. viticola involved in the interaction with resistance gene provides valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms that enable P. viti- cola to adapt to grapevine resistance, laying a foundation for developing strategies to manage this damaging crop pathogen.",,

This pipeline can be used with a custom NB-ARC HMM consensus protein sequence(s) built for a species of interest or related species for greater power, separately for each type of NBS-LRR (TNLs, CNLs, NLs) and combine them into a single fasta file for use. This pipeline shows high specificity for complete genes and structurally complete pseudogenes. However, candidate regions are identified but may not necessarily represent functional genes and does not itself do gene prediction. A domain identification step is also included and the output in gff3 format can be used for manual annotation of NLR genes. Therefore, it is primarily for the identification of NLR genes for a genome where either no annotation exists or a large number of genes are expected to be absent due to repeat masking and difficulties in annotation. For many genomes this may be the case. (2019-08-26)",Agricultural Sciences,

This program improves the differentiation between transmembrane regions present in the N-terminal part of a protein and the presence of a peptide signal. In order to further eliminate this potential problem, predicted signal peptides were cropped, with the remaining part of the proteins subjected to TMHMM (Krogh, Larsson, von Heijne, & Sonnhammer, 2001) for prediction of transmembrane regions.

How these different processes are orchestrated within organs and depend on specific cell types is poorly known. Here, using scRNAseq technology, we identified 18 distinct cell populations in wild-type Arabidopsis leaves inoculated with the hemibiotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae DC3000. Among those, we retrieved major cell types of the leaves (mesophyl, guard, epidermial, companion and vascular S cells) to which we could associate characteristic transcriptional reprogramming, thereby specifying different cell-type responses to the pathogen. Further analyses of transcriptional dynamics, based on inference of cell trajectories, indicated that the different cell types, in addition to their characteristic defense responses, can also share similar modules of gene reprogramming, allowing for instance vascular S cells, epidermal cells and mesophyl cells to converge towards an identical cell fate, mostly characterized by lignification and detoxification functions. Moreover, it appeared that defense responses of these three cell types can evolve along a second separate path. As this divergence does not correspond to the differentiation between immune and susceptible cells, we speculate that this might reflect the discrimination between cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous responses. Altogether our data provide an upgraded framework to describe, explore and explain the specialization and the coordination of plant cell responses upon pathogenic challenge.

The objective of this study was to further characterize the microbiota structure in SpA patients and to investigate the relationship between dysbiosis and disease activity, in light of the putative influence of genetic background.  

Methods: Shotgun sequencing was performed on fecal DNA isolated from stool samples of two groups of adult volunteers: SpA (N = 102) and healthy controls (N = 63). A subset of healthy controls comprised aged-matched siblings of patients with known HLA-B27 status. Changes in gut microbiota composition were assessed based on species diversity, enterotypes, taxonomical and functional differences.

Results: Dysbiosis was confirmed in SpA compared to healthy controls. Restriction of microbiota diversity was detected in patients with the most active disease and the abundance of several bacterial species was correlated to the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index. Among healthy controls, significant differences in microbiota composition were also detected between HLA-B27 positive and HLA-B27 negative siblings. We highlighted a decreased abundance of several species in SpA patients, especially belonging to Clostridiales order. Among the few species of increased abundance Ruminococcus. gnavus was one of the top differentiating species.

Conclusion: These findings reveal that genetic background, as well as the disease activity level, are likely to influence gut microbiota composition. It could be relevant for further research on chronic arthritis to focus on these key parameters.","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.42289

<h2>Metagenomic assembly</h2>
De novo metagenomic assembly was performed on the 153 samples from the data Source 2.
First, sequencing adapters removal and read trimming was performed with <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty560"">fastp</a>. Reads mapped on the host genome (GCF_000001635.27) with <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1923"">bowtie2</a> were removed with <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab008"">samtools</a>. Finally, Metagenomic assembly was performed with <a href="" https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.213959.116"">metaSPAdes</a>. Contigs of less than 1500 bp were removed.
<h2>MAGs recovery</h2>
Reads of each sample from the data Source 2 were aligned to their respective assembly with <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1923"">bowtie2</a> and results were indexed in sorted bam files with <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab008"">samtools</a>.

<h2>MSPs taxonomic annotation</h2>
Representative genomes of the MMGC collection were annotated with <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz848"">GTDB-Tk</a> based on GTDB r202. Then, taxonomic annotation of MMGC genomes was propagated to the corresponding MSPs.
<br><br>
For the MSPs without any corresponding MAG, taxonomic annotation was performed by alignment of all core and accessory genes against representative genomes of the GTDB database (release r202) using blastn (version 2.7.1, task = megablast, word_size = 16). A species-level assignment was given if > 50% of the genes matched the representative genome of a given species, with a mean nucleotide identity ≥ 95% and mean gene length coverage ≥ 90%. The remaining MSPs were assigned to a higher taxonomic level (genus to superkingdom), if more than 50% of their genes had the same annotation.

<h2>Construction of the phylogenetic tree</h2>
39 universal phylogenetic markers genes were extracted from the 1,252 MSPs (or the corresponding MAGs if available) with <a href="" https://github.com/motu-tool/fetchMGs"">fetchMGs</a>. Then, the markers were separately aligned with <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkh340"">MUSCLE</a>.

130,13, Omics Dataverse,UOVSPM,doi:10.57745/UOVSPM,2024-01-19,Major depletion in the insulin-sensitive signature of the gut microbiome in antiretroviral treatment-controlled persons living with HIV,,,,"Background.
Persons living with HIV (PWH) present microbiome alterations (higher abundance of Prevotella and lower abundance of Firmicutes and Ruminococcus lineages) vs. non-infected individuals. Some of these alterations are linked to sexual preference and others to the HIV infection. The relationship between these lineages and metabolic alterations, often present in aging PWH, has been poorly investigated. In this study, we compared fecal quantitative metagenomics profiles of 25 antiretroviral-treatment (ART)-controlled PWH to three independent control groups of 25 non-infected matched individuals by means of univariate analyses and machine learning methods. Moreover, we used two external datasets to validate predictive models of PWH classification. We analyzed associations between clinical and biological metabolic parameters and taxonomic and functional microbiome profiles. Finally, we quantified the altered microbiome signatures in 7 PWH after a 17-week ART switch to raltegravir/maraviroc.

Results.
Three major enterotypes (Prevotella, Bacteroides and Ruminococcaceae) were present in all groups. The first Prevotella enterotype was enriched in PWH, with several of its lineages associated with poor metabolic profiles (low HDL and adiponectin, high insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)). Conversely butyrate-producing lineages were markedly depleted in PWH independently of sexual preference and were associated with a better metabolic profile (higher HDL and adiponectin and lower HOMA-IR). Accordingly, butyrate production and amino-acid degradation modules were associated with high HDL and adiponectin and low HOMA-IR. Random Forest models trained to classify PWH vs. control on taxonomic abundances displayed high generalization performance on two external holdout datasets (ROC AUC of 80-82%). Finally, no significant alterations in microbiome composition were observed after switching to raltegravir/maraviroc.
 
Conclusion.
High resolution metagenomic analyses revealed major differences in the gut microbiome of ART-controlled PWH when compared with three independent matched cohorts of controls. The observed marked insulin resistance could result both from enrichment in Prevotella lineages, and from the depletion in species producing butyrate and involved into amino-acid degradation, which depletion is linked with the HIV infection.",Computer and Information Science,

Using elite endurance horses as a model system for exercise responsiveness, we built the first equine gut microbial gene catalog comprising more than 25 million non-redundant genes representing 4,696 genera spanning 95 phyla. The unprecedented resolution unrevealed functional pathways relevant for both the structure of the microbiome and the host health and recovered 369 novel metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes, providing useful reference for future studies. Integration of microbial and host omic datasets suggested that microbiomes harboring rare species were functionally dissimilar from those enriched in Lachnospiraceae taxa. Moreover, they offered expanded metabolic pathways to fine-tune the cardiovascular capacity through mitochondria-mediated mechanisms. The results identify an associative link between horse endurance capability and its microbiome gene function, laying the basis for nutritional interventions that could benefit endurance athletes.","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences",

The intermediates of yeast central carbon metabolism (CCM) are the building blocks of these biosynthetic pathways. Their production kinetics and intracellular availability depend on the balance of numerous single intracellular reactions, which together form intracellular fluxes. Therefore, efficient product biosynthesis is influenced by the distribution of these fluxes. 
We recently demonstrated great variations in the metabolic fluxes of CCM between yeast strains of different origins. However, due to the complexity of flux regulatory mechanisms, we have a limited understanding of how fluxes are modulated and even less knowledge about the genetic basis of variations in flux distributions.
In this study, we investigated the potential of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to elucidate the genetic variations responsible for differences in metabolic flux distributions (fQTL) using a population of 130 F2-segregants from a cross of two wine yeast strains. Intracellular metabolic fluxes were estimated by constraint-based modeling and used as quantitative phenotypes, and differences in fluxes were linked to genomic variations in the progeny population. Using this approach, we detected four fQTLs that influence metabolic pathways. The molecular dissection of these QTLs revealed the contribution of two allelic gene variants, PDB1 and VID30, which have an influence on glycolysis, glycerol synthesis, ethanol synthesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle fluxes and transport and excretion of main metabolites.
The elucidation of genetic determinants influencing metabolic fluxes, as reported here for the first time, creates new opportunities for the development of strains with optimized metabolite profiles for various applications using metabolic engineering or breeding strategies.

Here we present a method to retrieve the concentrations of the 16S rRNA gene per gram of any environmental sample using a synthetic standard in minuscule amounts (100 ppm to 1% of the 16S rRNA sequences) that is added to the sample before DNA extraction and quantified by 2 quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions. This allows normalizing by the initial microbial density, taking into account the DNA recovery yield. We quantified the internal standard and the total load of 16S rRNA genes by qPCR. The qPCR for the latter uses the exact same primers as those used for Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene to increase accuracy. We are able to calculate the absolute concentration of the species per gram of sample, taking into account the DNA recovery yield. This is crucial for an accurate estimate as the yield varied between 40 and 84%. This method avoids sacrificing a high proportion of the sequencing effort to quantify the internal standard. If sacrificing a part of the sequencing effort to the internal standard is acceptable, we however recommend that the internal standard accounts for 30% of the environmental 16S rRNA genes to avoid the PCR bias associated with rare phylotypes. The method proposed here was tested on a feces sample but can be applied more broadly on any environmental sample. This method offers a real improvement of metabarcoding of microbial communities since it makes the method quantitative with limited efforts.","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences",

We generated 25 sets of species manually extracted from UTAX (Simulated Data From UTAX = SDFU) and 25 others from SILVA (v123) databank (Quast, et al., 2013) (Simulated Data From SILVA = SDFS) (Figure1 of main text and companion website: tab SDFU/Datasets and SDFS/Datasets). We generated amplicons by (i) filtering out sequences with ambiguous nucleotides, (ii) keeping only bacterial species with non-ambiguous affiliation taxonomy and with pintail>50 for sequences from SILVA (Ashelford, et al., 2005), and (iii) with a match (with 10% of mismatches allowed) for the forward (TACGGRAGGCAGCAG) and reverse (TAGGATTAGATACCCTGGTA) primers in the V3V4 region and for the forward (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) primer in the V4 region,and (iv) maximizing the phylogenetic diversity of the amplicons in the full length 16S phylogenetic tree. This results in 25 increasingly complex nested databases. Grinder requires both error and abundance profiles to generate sequences. We used the following error parameters: the error rate increases linearly from 0.301% to 0.303% per base along the read, 98.6% of errors are SNPs and 1.4% are indels. These parameters were calibrated by mapping reads from a single strain (D'Amore, et al., 2016; Schirmer, et al., 2016; Schirmer, et al., 2015) MiSeq sequencing run to its known sequence to mimic typical MiSeq error profiles and agree with other reported values. We used the default n-mer distribution: 89% of bimeras, 11% trimeras and 0.3% of quadrimera, corresponding to the average values published in Quince et al. 2011 (Quince, et al., 2011). The fraction of chimera increased with the reference database size to reflect increasing sequence similarities: 5% for 20 taxa, 10% for 100 and 200 taxa and 20% for 500 and 1000 taxa. Chimera breakpoints were distributed uniformly along the amplicon. We considered two different abundance profiles: uniform and power law. For a power law abundance profile, parameters were calibrated to set the expected max/min abundance ratio to 100 (20 taxa), 1000 (100 and 200 taxa) or 10000 (500 and 1000 taxa). For each combination of database sizes (20/100/200/500/1000), abundance profiles (uniform, power law), amplicon regions (V3V4/V4), we generated 5 communities with different compositions. We then simulated 10 samples of 100000 reads each from each community. Finally, we used cutadapt (v1.7.1) to trim primers from the generated reads. Trimmed sequences were not preprocessed with quality filters but instead used as such in downstream analyses.","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences",

We investigated whether the alleviation of symptoms could be explained through modification of the host gut microbiota by hCAP18. Feces from mice were collected at day 7, before DNBS colitis induction, for 16S DNA sequencing. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from mouse fecal samples according to the protocol described by Godon et al. (Godon et al., Appl Environ Microbiol., 63(7):2802-13, 1997). The V3-V4 hyper-variable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by using the following primers: forward primer CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTACGGRAGGCWGCAG and reverse primer GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCT.

The Bacillus subtilis NDmed strain analyzed in this study is able to form thick and highly structurated submerged biofilms as described in Bridier et al., (2011) The Spatial Architecture of Bacillus subtilis Biofilms Deciphered Using a Surface-Associated Model and In Situ Imaging.   PLoS ONE 6(1):e16177.
A seven chip study using total RNA recovered from static  cultures of Bacillus subtilis NDmed growing in TSB medium in 96-well microplates for different times after adhesion to the bottom of the wells.  Each chip measures the expression level of 5,737 transcripts from Bacillus subtilis 168.

200 µL of an overnight culture of Bacillus subtilis NDmed in TSB (adjusted to an OD 600nm of 0.02) were added in each well of 96-well microtiter plates, incubated at 30°C for 90 min to allow the bacteria to adhere to the bottom of the wells. 
Wells were then rinsed with TSB to eliminate non-adherent bacteria and refilled with 200 µL of sterile TSB. For each time point (1h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 7h, 24h and 48h) 96-well plates were prepared.
Total RNA was extracted as described   by Nicolas et al., (2012) Science 335, 1103–1106 (PMID:22383849).  RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer; RNA quality was checked by analysis with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).
For cDNA synthesis, 10 µg of total RNA were mixed with random primers (FairPlay III Microarray Labeling Kit) and spike-ins (One-Color RNA Spike-In Kit, Agilent Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 min followed by 5 min incubation on ice. Then, first-strand Master Mix, Actinomycin D (final conc. 40 µg/ml) and AffinityScript HC Reverse Transcriptase were added. The reaction was incubated for 60 min at room temperature and for 60 min at 42°C. After hydrolyzing the RNA, cDNA was precipitated overnight at -20°C. NHS-ester dye coupling (CyDye Mono-Reactive Dye, GE Healthcare) and purification of labeled cDNA were performed according to the FairPlay III instructions. cDNA and Cy-dye concentrations were quantified by means of a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.
1200 ng of Cy3-labeled cDNA were hybridized to the tiling array following Agilent’s hybridization, washing and scanning protocol (One-Color Microarray-based Gene Expression Analysis, version 5.5).
The microarray (BaSysBio Bacillus subtilis T3 array, 2x400K [Agilent-044473]) was scanned with Agilent Technologies  Scanner, model G2505C. Grid: 044473_D_F_20121025. Protocol: GE1_107_Sep09.
An aggregated expression value was computed for each Genbank annotated CDS and newly defined transcribed region as the median log2 expression signal intensity of probes lying entirely within the corresponding region as described in (Nicolas et al., 2012 PMID: 22383849).
The expression intensity was computed from the raw intensity data using a model of signal shift and drift and correcting for probe affinity variations as described in (Nicolas et al., 2009, Bioinformatics 25, 2341-2347). Data were quantile normalized using LIMMA package.To control for possible cross-hybridization artefacts the sequence of each probe was BLAST-aligned against the whole chromosome sequence and probes with a SeqS value above the 1.5 cut-off were discarded (Wei et al., 2008 Nucl.

In fungi, STC that share a common ancestor catalyze a same cyclization mechanism:
•	clade 1 STC catalyze the 1,10-cyclization of (2E,6E)-FPP carbocation;
•	clade 2 STC catalyze the 1,10-cyclization of the (3R)-NPP carbocation;
•	clade 3 STC catalyze the 1,11 cyclization of (2E,6E)-FPP carbocation (trans-humulyl-type cyclases);
•	clade 4 STC catalyze the 1,6 or 1,7 cyclization of the (3R)-NPP carbocation.
Here, we provide robust HMM models for the identification of STC genes in basidiomycete genomes. Their classification into one of the four clades will give indication for the prediction of their cyclisation mechanism.","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences",

exhibits many vital functions to support the development of the chicken embryo
(gaseous exchange, innate defence, calcium transport from the eggshell to the embryo
skeleton, homeostasis). Developing from day 6 of incubation, the CAM progressively
differentiates into three functional layers (the chorionic epithelium in contact with the
inner eggshell, the highly vascularized mesoderm, and the allantoic epithelium),
between 11 and 15 days of incubation. This article describes the RNASeq dataset and
the analyses performed on total CAMs collected from male and female embryos after
11 and 15 days of incubation. The datasets are available at the NCBI Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) repository (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) using GSE199780 as the
accession number. The statistical analysis of the data allowed identifying genes
differentially expressed depending on the sex of the embryo at two time points of CAM
differentiation. Knowing that the CAM is widely used as a model to study tumour
growth, metastasis or wound healing, the resulting analysis highlights the necessity to
include this sex variable in experimental assays to avoid any bias of interpretation.
Indeed, the functional annotation of genes that are differentially expressed between
male and female CAMs revealed an enrichment of activities and functions related to
lipid metabolism, bone formation, and morphogenesis suggesting that the response of
the CAM to external and experimental stimuli might be different depending on the sex
of the embryo.",Agricultural Sciences,
